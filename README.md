# rayaverse-portfolio

Hello everyone! 

RayaVerse is my coffee-inspired digital portfolio showcasing my journey as a tech professional and educator. As someone who basically lives in cafes, I wanted to create a space that reflects my love for both technology and coffee culture. Here you'll find my projects ranging from fullstack app development to network systems, my experience in STEM education and social media management, and a glimpse into my self-taught coding adventures. Built using AI-assisted techniques with HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”because the best solutions happen over a good cup of coffee.
